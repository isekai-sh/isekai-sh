Isekai is a modern web application that helps artists manage their DeviantArt posting workflow with features like scheduled publishing, draft organization, and AI image generation integration through ComfyUI.

[Isekai Core](https://github.com/isekai-sh/isekai-core) is designed to be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. We support a variety of deployment strategies ranging from one-click PaaS solutions to highly available Kubernetes clusters.

## Why Self-Host?

- **Full Control**: Your data stays on your infrastructure
- **No Limits**: No artificial restrictions on uploads or storage (only DeviantArt's API limits apply)
- **Privacy**: Your DeviantArt credentials and artwork are never sent to third-party servers
- **Customizable**: Open-source and extensible for your specific needs
- **Cost-Effective**: Run on free-tier cloud services or your own hardware

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need:

1. **Technical Skills**: Basic knowledge of Docker and command-line operations
2. **Infrastructure**: A VPS, cloud platform, or local machine with Docker support
3. **DeviantArt Account**: An active DeviantArt account for API access
4. **Storage**: A Cloudflare R2 bucket (free tier available) for storing images
