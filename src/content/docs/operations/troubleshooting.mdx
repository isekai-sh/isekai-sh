Common issues and how to resolve them.

## "Upload Failed" or CORS Errors

**Symptom:** You try to upload an image in the Draft editor, but it immediately turns red or fails. Browser console shows a CORS error.

**Fix:** You need to configure CORS on your storage bucket. See the [Storage Setup guide](/requirements/storage-setup) for provider-specific CORS configuration. Your bucket MUST allow your frontend domain to send PUT requests.

## DeviantArt Login Loop or "Invalid Redirect URI"

**Symptom:** Clicking "Login with DeviantArt" redirects you to DA, but then gives an error or redirects back without logging in.

**Fix:**

<Steps>

1. Check your DeviantArt Developers Portal.

2. Ensure the Redirect URI matches exactly.

   - If your site is `https://isekai.com`, the URI must be `https://api.isekai.com/api/auth/deviantart/callback`.
   - Note the `https` and the specific path.

3. Ensure your `DEVIANTART_REDIRECT_URI` env var matches that value exactly.

</Steps>

## Scheduled Posts Not Publishing

**Symptom:** A post was scheduled for 10:00 AM, but it's now 10:05 AM and it's still "Scheduled".

**Fix:**

- Check the Publisher container logs.
- Is the container running?
- Check the timezone. The scheduler runs in UTC. Ensure you set your timezone correctly in the Settings page.
- If the logs show "Job Stalled", restart the publisher container.

## "Rate Limit Exceeded"

**Symptom:** The app says you are checking DA too fast.

**Fix:** The app has a built-in rate limiter (Leaky Bucket) and Circuit Breaker.

- Wait 5 minutes. The Circuit Breaker will reset.
- If this happens often, increase `RATE_LIMITER_BASE_DELAY_MS` in your environment variables (default is 3000ms).

## Database Connection Errors

**Symptom:** `P1001: Can't reach database server`.

**Fix:**

- **Docker:** Ensure the postgres container is healthy.
- **Managed DB:** Check if your VPS IP is allowed in your database provider's "Trusted Sources" or firewall settings.
