Automating your workflow is powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility. Isekai Core is designed to be a "good citizen" of the DeviantArt ecosystem, but it relies on you to configure it correctly.

## Avoiding Rate Limits (Error 429)

DeviantArt protects its servers by limiting how many requests you can make in a short period. If you see `429 Too Many Requests`, it means you are moving too fast.

### The "Content" Limit

<Aside type="caution">
Unlike standard API calls (like browsing), uploading files (`stash/submit` and `stash/publish`) has much stricter limits. Posting too many deviations instantly can trigger a temporary ban on your IP or Access Token.

### Recommended Tuning for Bulk Uploaders

If you plan to upload dozens of images at once, you should slow down the publisher. Fast uploads are not necessary for background jobs—reliability is more important than speed.

Edit these values in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Reduce concurrency to 1 or 2.
# Default is 5, which might be too aggressive for bulk uploads.
PUBLISHER_CONCURRENCY=1

# Increase the delay between API calls.
# Default is 3000ms (3s). 5000ms-10000ms (5-10s) is much safer.
RATE_LIMITER_BASE_DELAY_MS=5000

# Add jitter to make behavior look less robotic.
RATE_LIMITER_JITTER_PERCENT=30
```

### The Circuit Breaker

Isekai Core includes a built-in Circuit Breaker. If it detects multiple 429 errors:

- It stops all publishing jobs immediately.
- It enters an "Open" state for 5 minutes (default `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN_DURATION_MS`).
- Jobs will fail with "Circuit Open" message to protect your account from further bans.
- After the cooldown, it tries one job to see if the limit is lifted.

## Scheduling vs. Dumping

Just because you can upload 100 images in 5 minutes doesn't mean you should.

### Why "Dumping" is Bad

- **Algorithm Penalty**: DeviantArt's algorithm (and Watch feeds) may flag rapid-fire uploads as spam.
- **User Fatigue**: Your watchers will be overwhelmed if you flood their inbox with 50 notifications in one minute, leading to unwatches.
- **Ban Risk**: High frequency increases the chance of automated spam detection flagging your account.

### The Isekai Strategy

<Steps>

1. Upload your bulk batch of 20 images to **Drafts**.

2. Select them all.

3. Click **Auto-Schedule**.

4. Let Isekai release them over the next few days (e.g., 1 post every 6 hours).

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
This maximizes engagement (your art stays at the top of feeds longer) and keeps your account safe.

## Compliance & Tagging

### AI Generation

DeviantArt requires AI-generated content to be tagged properly.

- In **Settings > Default Values**, enable "Mark as AI Generated".
- This ensures the `ai_generated` flag is sent with every API request, keeping you compliant with DA Terms of Service.

### Mature Content

<Aside type="caution">
Always strictly tag mature content. If you are unsure, use the "Strict" setting in the Draft editor.

Failure to tag mature content correctly is a violation of DeviantArt policies and can result in account suspension.
