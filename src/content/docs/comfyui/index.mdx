Isekai Comfy Node is a collection of custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://comfyui.com/) that integrates well with your [Isekai Core](/overview/start-here) deployment. 
These nodes allow you to upload images directly to Isekai, compress images before saving, manipulate strings for prompts, and generate titles using local Ollama LLMs.

<Aside type="note">
If you don't use Isekai Core, you can also skip the integration and use the image compression and string utility nodes standalone within ComfyUI. These nodes are useful for regular batch processing workflows and will work as is, even without an API key.
