The Isekai Chrome Extension requires configuration before it can start processing jobs. This guide covers all configuration options.

## Initial Setup

<Steps>

1. Click the **Isekai extension icon** in your browser toolbar

2. The popup will show a warning: "API not configured"

3. Click the **Console** button to open the settings page

4. Click the **Settings** button in the toolbar

</Steps>

## Required Settings

### API URL

The URL of your Isekai Core backend deployment.

**Examples:**
- `https://api.isekai.example.com` (production)
- `https://isekai.ngrok-free.app` (development with ngrok)
- `http://localhost:3000` (local development)

<Aside type="note">
The API URL should point to your backend server, not your frontend dashboard. It's the base URL without any path suffix.
</Aside>

### API Key

Your personal API key generated from the Isekai dashboard.

<Steps>

1. Open your Isekai frontend dashboard (e.g., `https://dashboard.isekai.example.com`)

2. Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)

3. Scroll to the **API Keys** section

4. Click **Create New Key**

5. Copy the generated key (starts with `isk_`)

6. Paste it into the extension's **API Key** field

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
Never share your API key with anyone. It provides full access to your Isekai account. Treat it like a password.
</Aside>

## Advanced Settings

### Retry Attempts

**Default:** `10`
**Range:** `1-20`

Number of times the extension will attempt to communicate with the content script before marking a job as failed.

When a DeviantArt page is slow to load or the content script doesn't respond immediately, the extension will retry with exponential backoff.

**Recommended values:**
- Fast connection: `5-8`
- Slow connection: `10-15`
- Very slow/unstable: `15-20`

<Aside type="tip">
If you see "Failed to communicate with content script" errors frequently, increase this value.
</Aside>

### Max Retry Delay

**Default:** `30` seconds
**Range:** `5-120` seconds

Maximum wait time between retry attempts when the content script doesn't respond.

The extension uses exponential backoff, starting at 1 second and doubling each time:
- Attempt 1: 1 second
- Attempt 2: 2 seconds
- Attempt 3: 4 seconds
- Attempt 4: 8 seconds
- Attempt 5: 16 seconds
- Attempt 6: 30 seconds (capped at max delay)
- Subsequent attempts: 30 seconds

**Recommended values:**
- Fast DeviantArt pages: `15-30` seconds
- Slow DeviantArt pages: `30-60` seconds
- Very slow pages: `60-120` seconds

<Aside type="note">
This setting only affects communication with the content script, not the job polling interval from your backend.
</Aside>

## Saving Configuration

<Steps>

1. Fill in all required fields (API URL and API Key)

2. Optionally adjust advanced settings

3. Click **Save Settings**

4. The modal will close and settings will be applied immediately

5. Return to the popup to verify the API status shows "API HEALTHY"

</Steps>

## Verifying Configuration

After saving your settings:

1. **Check API Status:**
   - Open the popup or console page
   - Look for "API HEALTHY" in green
   - If you see "API UNREACHABLE" or "NOT CONFIGURED", check your settings

2. **Check Start Button:**
   - The Start button should be enabled (not grayed out)
   - If it's still disabled, verify both API URL and API Key are set

3. **Test Connection:**
   - Click **Start** in the popup
   - Check the console page for logs
   - You should see "Polling for next job..." messages

## Configuration Storage

All settings are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API:

- **Location:** Browser-specific encrypted storage
- **Persistence:** Settings survive browser restarts
- **Privacy:** Never synced to cloud (even with Chrome Sync enabled)
- **Scope:** Per-browser profile (different profiles have separate settings)

<Aside type="caution">
If you clear your browser data and select "Site settings" or "Cookies and other site data", your extension configuration will be deleted. Keep a backup of your API key.
</Aside>

## Updating Configuration

To change your settings later:

<Steps>

1. Open the console page (click **Console** in popup)

2. Click the **Settings** button in the toolbar

3. Modify the values you want to change

4. Click **Save Settings**

5. Changes take effect immediately without needing to restart

</Steps>

## Configuration for Multiple Accounts

If you manage multiple Isekai accounts:

1. **Use Browser Profiles:**
   - Create a separate Chrome profile for each account
   - Each profile has independent extension settings
   - Switch profiles to switch accounts

2. **Or Use Different Browsers:**
   - Install in Chrome for Account A
   - Install in Edge for Account B
   - Each browser maintains separate settings

<Aside type="tip">
Browser profiles are the cleanest way to manage multiple accounts. You can switch between them quickly without reconfiguring.
</Aside>

## Resetting Configuration

To reset all settings to defaults:

<Steps>

1. Open your browser's extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`)

2. Find **Isekai** in the list

3. Click **Remove** to uninstall

4. Reinstall the extension using the [installation guide](/chrome-extension/installation)

5. Reconfigure from scratch

</Steps>

Alternatively, you can clear just the extension's data:

<Steps>

1. Right-click the extension icon

2. Select **Inspect popup** (opens DevTools)

3. In the Console tab, run:
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.clear()
   ```

4. Close DevTools and reload the extension
