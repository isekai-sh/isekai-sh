The Isekai Chrome Extension provides two interfaces to help you manage your exclusive sales: a compact popup widget for quick controls and a full-featured console page for monitoring your sales activities.

## Popup Widget

The popup widget is accessed by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

### Status Indicators

**Extension Status:**
- **Stopped** (gray): Extension is not active
- **Active** (green): Extension is ready and monitoring your sales queue
- **Processing** (yellow): Currently helping with a sale listing

**Connection Status:**
- **Checking** (gray): Verifying connection to your dashboard
- **API Healthy** (green): Successfully connected to your Isekai dashboard
- **API Unreachable** (red): Cannot connect to your dashboard
- **Not Configured** (gray): Setup required (API URL or API key not set)

### Statistics

When the extension is active, you'll see:

- **Processed**: Total sales you've listed (succeeded + failed)
- **Succeeded**: Sales successfully listed on DeviantArt
- **Failed**: Listings that encountered errors and need attention

Statistics persist across browser sessions and reset only when you clear logs.

### Controls

**Start Button:**
- Activates the extension to begin monitoring your sales queue
- Only enabled when your dashboard connection is configured
- Turns into a **Stop** button when active

**Stop Button:**
- Pauses the extension from checking for new sales to list
- Allows currently processing listings to complete

## Console Page

The console page provides a comprehensive view of all sales listing activities, helping you maintain detailed business records.

  <TabItem label="From Popup">
    Click the **Console** button in the popup widget
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="From Context Menu">

### Console Layout

The console has three main areas:

1. **Left Panel (2/3 width):** Real-time activity log
2. **Right Panel (1/3 width):** Listing history
3. **Bottom Bar:** Statistics summary

### Activity Log

**Log Levels:**
- **DEBUG** (gray): Technical details about extension operations
- **INFO** (blue): General information (queue checks, listings received, etc.)
- **SUCCESS** (green): Successfully completed listings
- **WARNING** (yellow): Non-critical issues that may need attention
- **ERROR** (red): Failed operations requiring review

**Log Filtering:**

<Steps>

1. Use the checkboxes at the top to show/hide log levels:
   - DEBUG
   - INFO
   - SUCCESS
   - WARNING
   - ERROR

2. Unchecking a level hides all logs of that type

3. Your filter preferences are saved automatically

</Steps>

**Log Limit:**

Select how many recent logs to display:
- 100 (faster rendering)
- 200
- 500
- 1000 (default)
- All (may slow down on very large log files)

**Auto-Scroll:**

Toggle the **SCROLL** checkbox to enable/disable automatic scrolling to the latest log entry.

<Aside type="tip">
Disable auto-scroll when you want to review older logs without the view jumping to the bottom.
</Aside>

### Listing History

The right panel shows all your exclusive sale listings with:

- **Artwork Title**: Name of the deviation
- **Deviation URL**: Link to the DeviantArt page (clickable)
- **Price**: Listing price in USD
- **Listing ID**: Unique identifier for your records
- **Status**: Completed (green) / Failed (red) / Processing (yellow)

**Settings:**

## Best Practices for Artists

### Maintain Your DeviantArt Session

The extension works with your existing DeviantArt account. For best results:

- Stay logged into DeviantArt in the same browser profile
- Keep your session active (don't log out while the extension is running)
- Use the same browser for both browsing DeviantArt and running the extension

If your session expires, the extension will pause and notify you to log back in.

### Review Your Activity Regularly

Check the console page to maintain oversight of your business:

- Verify listings are being created successfully
- Catch any pricing or configuration issues early
- Monitor for patterns if multiple listings fail
- Export logs for tax records and business documentation

### Organize Your Queue

For efficient listing management:

- Queue up multiple artworks in your Isekai dashboard
- Set accurate prices before adding to queue
- Process listings during times when you're available to monitor
- Start with small batches to ensure everything works correctly

### Resource Considerations

The extension works respectfully with your browser:

- Background tabs open briefly and close automatically
- Listings are processed one at a time to avoid overwhelming DeviantArt
- Your regular browsing is not interrupted

For large listing batches (50+ artworks):

- Allow adequate time for processing
- Monitor your computer's performance
- Consider processing in smaller batches for better control

### Keep Records

Maintain good business practices:

1. Export activity logs regularly for your records
2. Back up your API credentials securely
3. Review listing history for accounting purposes
4. Save configuration settings before browser updates

These records help with tax preparation and business management.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Extension Not Starting

**Symptoms:** Start button is disabled or grayed out

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API URL and API key are configured
2. Check API status shows "Healthy"
3. Try clicking Settings and saving configuration again

### No Jobs Processing

**Symptoms:** Extension is running but no jobs appear

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your backend queue has pending items
2. Check you're logged into DeviantArt
3. Review console logs for errors
4. Ensure polling interval hasn't been changed to a very long value

### Jobs Failing Repeatedly

**Symptoms:** Multiple jobs showing "Failed" status

**Solutions:**
1. Check you're logged into DeviantArt
2. Verify deviation URLs are valid
3. Review error messages in console logs
4. Try processing one job manually to identify the issue
