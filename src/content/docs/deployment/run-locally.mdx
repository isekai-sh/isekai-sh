<Aside>
As of v0.1.0-alpha.2, only Cloudflare R2 is officially supported. We will support other S3 compatible storage options such as AWS S3, Digital Ocean Space, MinIO, and other object storage in the future. Local installation still need Cloudflare R2 to properly function.
</Aside>

You don't need a VPS to run Isekai Core if you prefer local installation. You can run the full application on your personal computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux) using Docker Desktop and Isekai Core will still function almost 100% offline.

This is the recommended method for:

- Testing the application before deploying
- Personal usage
- Developing custom integrations

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop: Download and install [Docker Desktop for your Operating System](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [DeviantArt Application](/requirements/deviantart-application)
- [Cloudflare R2 Storage](/requirements/cloudflare-r2-setup)

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

1. Set up your directory

    Open your terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Terminal) and create a folder for the project:

    ```bash
    # Create a folder
    mkdir isekai
    cd isekai

    # Download the production compose file
    curl -o docker-compose.yml [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isekai-sh/isekai-core/main/docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isekai-sh/isekai-core/main/docker-compose.yml)

    # Download the env example
    curl -o .env [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isekai-sh/isekai-core/main/.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isekai-sh/isekai-core/main/.env.example)
    ```

    __Note: On Windows PowerShell, you might need to use Invoke-WebRequest or just download the files manually from the browser.__

2. Configure your [Environment Variables](/resources/environment-variables)
    
    Open the .env file in a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code) and edit frontend and backend URLs:

    ```ini
    NODE_ENV=production
    PORT=4000

    # Frontend accesses Backend here
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api

    # Browser accesses Frontend here
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

    Edit your DeviantArt Application credentials:

    ```ini
    DEVIANTART_CLIENT_ID=12345
    DEVIANTART_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
    DEVIANTART_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4000/api/auth/deviantart/callback
    ```

    Fill in your R2_ credentials which you can obtain from the Cloudflare dashboard:
    ```ini
    R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
    R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
    R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
    R2_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
    R2_PUBLIC_URL=[https://your-bucket.r2.dev](https://your-bucket.r2.dev)
    ```

    Generate strong random strings for session management and encryption. You can use a password generator or run `openssl rand -hex 32` in a terminal.

    ```ini
    SESSION_SECRET=long_random_string_here
    ENCRYPTION_KEY=32_byte_hex_string_here
    ```

3. Run The Container

    Start the application stack:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    Docker will download the images (Frontend, Backend, Publisher, Postgres, Redis) and start them. This might take a few minutes the first time.

4. Access the app

    - Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
    - You should see the login screen
    - Click "Login with DeviantArt"
</Steps>


## Managing the App

### Stopping the App
To stop the app and free up system resources:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Updating

To update to the latest version of Isekai Core:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```



## Where is my data?

By default, Docker stores the database data in a "volume" managed by Docker Desktop (except for the images stored in R2 object storage). Your data persists even if you restart your computer or stop the containers.
