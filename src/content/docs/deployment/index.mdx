Isekai allows you to self-host your own art management platform. Since the application is fully [containerized](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-containerization?hl=en), you can deploy it on almost any infrastructure that supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

There are many ways to deploy Isekai beyond what we demonstrate here in the docs. To make it simple, we have created four different guides to deploy Isekai, depending on your technical expertise and infrastructure needs.
